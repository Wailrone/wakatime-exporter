# ðŸš€ Wakatime exporter

This is a simple node.js application that exports your wakatime data to a database. 
You can then use this data to create your own dashboards or reports (with Metabase for example).

- Copy `.env.dev` to `.env`
- Fill in the `.env` file with your wakatime api key
- Run `docker compose up -d`
